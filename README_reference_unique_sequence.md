1. Split the Compressed .tar.gz File: Use the split command to split the compressed .tar.gz file into smaller parts without recompression:

bash
split -b 80M combined_isoform_50mer_csv_files.tar.gz combined_part
This command divides the compressed file into smaller parts without altering the data.

2. Uploading the Split Parts: After splitting the file, the resulting split parts (combined_partaa, combined_partab, etc.) can be uploaded to GitHub or any other platform.

3. Reassembling the Original File: When the split parts are downloaded, they can be concatenated back together using the cat command and then decompressed to reconstruct the original .tar.gz file:

bash
cat combined_part* > combined_isoform_50mer_csv_files.tar.gz
