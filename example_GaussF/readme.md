Example Usage of GaussF Pipeline
This section provides a detailed example of how to run the pipeline_abundance_GaussF_esti_loop.py script for k-mer count analysis using sequencing data. The accompanying transcript CSV files, which contain the k-mer sequencing counts, are also available in the gaussf folder within this repository.

Running the Script
To execute the script, use the following command in your terminal:
python pipeline_abundance_GaussF_esti_loop.py
--input /path/to/unique_frequence_csv
--output /path/to/results_file.txt

Replace /path/to/unique_frequence_csv with the full path to your input CSV file containing unique k-mer frequencies, and replace /path/to/results_file.txt with the desired path where you want the output results to be saved.

Example Data
In the gaussf > example_GaussF folder, we have uploaded 14 example CSV files representing transcript k-mers and their sequencing counts. These files are prepared for use with the GaussF pipeline and provide a comprehensive dataset to process with the script for an unbiased total count estimation.

Output Results
The output of the script has also been uploaded to this repository for reference. The results file allows you to compare and verify the output generated by running the GaussF pipeline with the provided example data.
